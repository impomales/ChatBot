This project is designed to provide experience working with multiple platforms for Chatbots (required is use of either Watson Assistant and Amazon Lex and a second of your choice).

The chatbot's purpose can be your choice but should be able to help a user solve some kind of problem and be capable of using an external API to get the user useful information.

A leisurely example might be a chatbot assist you in finding a TV show or Movie to watch.

A more practical (preferred) example could be an internal app to help book a conference room at Galvanize. Both would require the date, time, number of users, and to incorporate with an external system.

## Requirements

* UI build in framework of your choosing
* Chat input with scrollable chat history
  * Dynamic response nodes that may include:
    * Customs styles
    * External links
    * Link Previews
* # Generated Documenation using library of your choice

* Login with User Authentication
* Build chatbot using minimally 2 AI platforms (Watson Assistant and Amazon Lex)
* NodeJs Backend
* End to End and Unit testing
* Ability to select chatbot platform by app launch configuration
* Deployment procedure configurable by environment.
* Source Control w/ Git with appropriate branch management.
* Protection of assets (API keys and any proprietary info should not be committed)

## Nice to have

* Sprints and milestone tracking
* Kanban boards (feature development)
* Bug tracking / QA
* Sofware delivery and deployment
* Automatable and repeatable processes

<<<<<<< HEAD

### Getting started

* Create a source code repo using github, gitlab, or bitbucket
* Create a kanban board
* Create a project wiki (for Release Notes)
* Create your development environment

During this phase you should do some basic setup and configure you development environment, build process and automated testing process. Depending on your chosen framework some tooling may be be provided out of the box.

The first view should be a login page with a username an password field.

# This is good time to verify that your end to end tests are working. You should have a test verifying the expected rendering of your login form.

You should also have a unit test verifying connectivity with one of the chat platforms
